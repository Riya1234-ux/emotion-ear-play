Project Overview

This project is an AI- and machine-learning–driven emotion-based music recommendation system built as part of my exploration into rapid AI product development using AI-assisted tools. The system focuses on detecting or interpreting user emotion and mapping it to suitable music selections in real time.

The goal was to quickly transform an AI concept into a functional product while keeping the system flexible, scalable, and open to future model improvements.

Goals

Build an emotion-aware music system using AI/ML

Explore emotion recognition and affect-based recommendation logic

Rapidly prototype a working AI-driven product

Create a scalable foundation for future model and data enhancements

What we Worked On

Defining emotion categories and their mapping to music attributes

Designing AI-driven logic for emotion-based music selection

Implementing system behavior around emotional input

Iterating on recommendation logic for better relevance

Structuring the application for future ML model integration

Key Features

Emotion-based music recommendation

AI-driven decision logic at the core of the system

Adaptive structure for future machine learning models

Designed for experimentation and expansion

Tools & Tech

Lovable.dev – AI-assisted product development

Frontend: React / Tailwind CSS (adjust if needed)

AI / ML: Emotion recognition and recommendation logic

Development Approach: AI-first, rapid iteration, experimentation

Process

Started with the idea of emotion-aware music selection

Built a functional version quickly using AI-assisted tools

Iterated on emotion-to-music mapping logic

Refined system behavior through focused improvements

This approach allowed fast validation of the core AI concept while keeping the system extensible.

Outcome

The result is a functional emotion-based music system that demonstrates my approach to AI/ML product development, rapid prototyping, and iterative refinement. While the system can be expanded with more advanced emotion detection models and personalized learning, it already serves as a strong proof of concept.

Notes

This project is part of my ongoing portfolio and reflects my interest in affective computing, emotion-aware AI systems, and AI-driven recommendation technologies.
