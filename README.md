This project is a UI-focused web application built as part of my exploration into rapid product design and development using AI-assisted tools. The emphasis was on clean layouts, usability, and turning an idea into a working product quickly.

Project overview

The goal of this project was to design and build a functional interface that feels intuitive and purposeful. Rather than starting with heavy setup, I focused on user flow, visual hierarchy, and interaction design, refining the product through continuous iteration.

This allowed me to move fast while still paying attention to UX details.

What I worked on

UI layout and visual structure

User flow and interaction decisions

Iterative design improvements based on usability

Translating ideas into working features

Refining the experience through small, focused changes

Key features

Clean, responsive interface

Clear user flow and navigation

Scalable structure for future features

Designed with usability and clarity in mind

Tools & tech

Lovable.dev – AI-assisted product building

Frontend: (add React / Tailwind / etc. if applicable)

Design approach: UX-first, iterative, user-centred

Process

Started with a basic idea and rough structure

Built a working version quickly

Iterated on layout, spacing, and interactions

Refined based on usability and clarity

This approach helped balance speed with thoughtful design.

Outcome

The result is a functional, presentable product that demonstrates my approach to UI/UX design, rapid prototyping, and iteration. The project can be expanded further, but already serves as a solid proof of concept.

Notes

This project is part of my ongoing portfolio and reflects my interest in building usable, well-designed interfaces with modern tools.
